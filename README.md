# memory-drawer

A simple project to draw a sine curve in the memory view of Task Manager on Windows 10.

All help is welcome :)

Current Issues:
----------------
* Clearing the memory when the curve gets to the local maximum point just causes the curve to reset at the initial point
* The curve is too stretched out, introduce a coefficient of X to correct this

TO-DO
----------------
* Try writing the program with different threads to force the memory to clear
